# Welcome!

This blog was created as our final project for [EDLD 654](https://uo-datasci-specialization.github.io/c4-ml-fall-2020/index.html). This course focused on applied machine learning techniques for educational data scientists, with an emphasis on supervised learning methods. Considering the primary goal of these methods is to create models capable of making accurate predictions, we had to work together as a team to build a predictive model for unseen data. Here, we provide a description of the data used and our analysis procedure, along with an analysis of model performance and a description of why we chose the final model we did.

**Ashley L. Miller, M.S.**

```{r out.width="20%",echo=FALSE,out.extra='style="float:left;padding-right:40px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Ash.png")
```

Ashley is a doctoral candidate studying memory and attention processes. Specifically, Ashley’s research seeks to identify sources of limitations in learning abilities--and cognitive abilities more broadly--by focusing on how individuals control attention in a goal directed manner. Ashley leverages behavioral and physiological techniques (pupillometry and eye-tracking) to address these questions.

**Stephanie Gluck, M.A.**

```{r out.width="20%",echo=FALSE,out.extra='style="float:left;padding-right:40px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Steph.png")
```

Stephanie is a doctoral student studying developmental psychology at the University of Oregon. Her research addresses how children become socially aware of others’ thoughts, intentions and emotions – a crucial ability for success in the social world – along with the underlying social and cognitive mechanisms that influence such development.
